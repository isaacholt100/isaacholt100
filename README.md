### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a mathematics student at Durham University, and I love to code in my free time. I am currently learning Go and Flutter. My main coding project at the moment is a Rust library that defines arbitrarily big integer types that behave exactly like the primitive integer types: [bint](https://github.com/isaacholt100/bint)
